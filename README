-- Desc --
Minimal application written in haskell which calculates cpu usage percent from /proc/stat.

-- Compiling --
$ ghc haskell-cpu-usage -o haskell-cpu-usage.out

-- Usage --
$ haskell-cpu-usage.out <number-of-cores>

-- Help --
if you have N cores, number-of-cores must be N+1. 1 is reserved for general cpu usage.
number-of-cores == 1 -> [cpu]
number-of-cores == 2 -> [cpu, cpu1]
number-of-cores == 3 -> [cpu, cpu1, cpu2]
number-of-cores == N -> [cpu, cpu1, cpu2, ..., cpuN]
